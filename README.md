## Code and Data for [Redundancy masking of faces reveals a substantial failure to detect socially relevant information]
This repository contains the code and data used in [Crowding, redundancy masking and the radial-tangential anisotropy of numerosity estimation].

## Paper Abstract

Faces are crucial for social interactions and usually can be detected rapidly and accurately. However, we show that face detection frequently failed when faces were presented in small groups. In two experiments, we presented a small number of identical faces and control stimuli (Experiment 1), and identical upright faces and upside-down faces (Experiment 2) either to the left or right of the visual field. Participants indicated the number of items in Experiment 1, and reported both the number of faces and their orientations in Experiment 2. We observed that the number of reported items (both obtained and predicted mean) was frequently lower than the actual number of presented items. We suggest that redundancy masking (RM), the reduction of the number of perceived items in repeating patterns, occurs with faces. We shed light on the complex nature of face perception and highlight the challenges in detecting identical faces in the periphery.
